# Reforge.Infra.PersistenceTests

Tests the real EF Core adapters in `Reforge.Infra/Persistence` directly through their port
interfaces (`IUserRepository`), against one real, migrated Postgres container (Testcontainers),
reset to empty between tests.

## What this project is for — and, as importantly, what it isn't

**It does not test business logic, and it is not a second `Reforge.Core.Tests`.** Application
logic is covered there, cheaply, against `Reforge.Infra.Lite`'s hand-written in-memory fakes —
that stays the default, and stays the right choice for anything a fake can faithfully reproduce.

This project exists only for the narrow class of bug an in-memory fake **cannot** reproduce,
because it isn't running SQL against a real relational engine at all:

- **Real conflict/upsert behavior.** `UserRepository.UpsertAsync` issues a raw
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ("Id") DO NOTHING` to absorb a concurrent first-sync race — the
  in-memory fake is a plain dictionary with no real conflict semantics to get wrong, so it can't
  catch a regression here.
- **EF query/update translation.** `UserRepository.UpdateLastAccessAsync` relies on
  `ExecuteUpdateAsync` translating a single-column update into SQL server-side; a fake backed by
  `List<T>`/`Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` runs plain C# assignment instead and can't fail the way the
  real adapter can.

If a test here would pass or fail identically against an in-memory fake, it belongs in
`Reforge.Core.Tests` instead, not here. Before adding a test to this project, be able to name the
real-Postgres-only behavior it exists to catch — the way each existing test's doc comment does.

## Why not `api/acceptance-tests`?

`api/acceptance-tests` also runs against a real Postgres, but treats the backend as an opaque
Docker image, reachable only over HTTP: it exists to catch a break in the built artifact's wire
contract, not to pinpoint which repository method mistranslated a query. Routing a query/upsert
bug through OIDC token exchange, HTTP auth, controller model binding, and a manager just to
observe it via a JSON response body adds a large surface that can just as easily mask the bug (or
fail for an unrelated reason) as reveal it — and it isn't what that project is for either; see its
own README's "no second copy of the domain test suite" rule. This project calls the real adapter
directly, so a failure here points at the adapter itself.

## How it's structured

- **`PostgresFixture`** — an `ICollectionFixture` shared by every test class in
  `PersistenceTestCollection`: one Postgres container, migrated once per test run (starting a
  container and running migrations is the expensive part). `ResetAsync()` truncates every
  `ReforgeDbContext` table between tests, so each test starts from a genuinely empty database
  instead of relying on unique ids or before/after deltas to dodge other tests' rows.
- **`PersistenceTestBase`** — resets the database in `IAsyncLifetime.InitializeAsync()`, which
  xunit runs before every test method (it constructs a fresh test class instance per `[Fact]`).
  Every test class inherits from this instead of implementing `IAsyncLifetime` by hand.
- Every test class also carries `[Collection(PersistenceTestCollection.Name)]` — this is what
  actually shares the fixture and serializes these tests against the one container; xunit does
  not reliably honor a `[Collection]` attribute inherited from `PersistenceTestBase` alone.
- Tests construct the real repository class directly (`new UserRepository(dbContext)`) against
  a real `ReforgeDbContext`.

## Running

`./scripts/verify backend-persistence` from the repository root. Requires a running Docker
daemon (Testcontainers talks to it directly, same as `api/acceptance-tests`).
